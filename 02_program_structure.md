# Program Structure

In this section, we will discuss the structure of a C program. A typical C program includes following elements:

### The Preprocessor Directives
The program begins with preprocessor directives. Preprocessor directives are lines included in the code of programs preceded by a hash sign (#). For example, #include <stdio.h>
---

### The main() Function
Every C program must contain a main() function. This is where the execution of the program begins.
---

### Variable Declarations
Variables need to be declared before use. C requires you to specify the data type of variables.
---

### Statements & Expressions
Statements are simple or compound expressions terminated by a semicolon. For example, x = y + z;
---

### Comments
Comments are for documentation and are not executed by the compiler. For example, // This is a comment.
---

### Return Statement
The return statement is the last statement in the main() function. It returns control to the operating system.
